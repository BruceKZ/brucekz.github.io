<p>Many dog owners struggle to give their dogs enough companionship and daily walks due to busy work schedules or health constraints. At the same time, many dog lovers are unable to keep dogs themselves because of housing rules or financial limits, but would love the chance to spend time with them. <strong>DogLink</strong> bridges this gap by connecting dog owners with dog enthusiasts who can help with walking, playtime, and companionship.</p>
<p>Beyond that, DogLink provides a dedicated community where dog owners can share posts and videos, access reliable veterinary information, and keep track of their dogsâ€™ health records. It creates a trusted space for social connection, practical support, and better care for dogs.</p>
